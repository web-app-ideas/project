# Project

> Despite the fact that the development of the web-based app is pretty similar to the regular desktop application one it has some differences that may impact the overall process and make it more complex in some aspects. In this project, we are going to explain each stage of the web application development process, name key specialists who can take part in the project, and map their area of responsibilities.

If you’re in, don’t wait any longer. Keep on reading. Below is an essential guide for current and future product owners and anyone who wants to learn about the new-IT product-development cycle step-by-step.

## Web Application Development Process in Practice
Creating a web application architecture is a highly organized, comprehensive process where the main goal is to develop a product that meets your business needs. We have listed the 6 main steps based on our work and experience. Proper planning is crucial to achieving success when developing a new product, so we always follow a proven process and use the best methods. So let’s move on to the steps.

### 1. Complex Analysis
To make a successful product, you must prepare the right strategy and think over your idea, including analyzing your target audience. Your development team should explore your needs, the project scope, and the functionalities needed.

It all should start with testing your idea from various angles. After a detailed project analysis, the dedicated team can prepare IT-project costs estimates, proposals for the team that will work toward the project’s success, technological proposals, and more.

### 2. Planning
Your technological partner can determine the time and specialists needed to achieve the most important goals. As part of the planning stage, the dedicated team comprehensively prepares an action plan, taking into account the time needed to implement the project.

During the planning stage, we set future meetings, including daily meetings, two-week sprints, and retrospective meetings after sprint reviews. The functionality deliveries are cyclical because the process is based on scrum methodology. This iterative process aims to divide the work into smaller parts and deliver them at regular intervals.

### 3. Product
Now it’s time to determine how your product will look to satisfy your users. This is when we need to carefully consider the product’s visual side and its UX/UI design.

> Well-designed UX and UI are a big part of an IT product’s success—intuitive navigation and a user-friendly design attract customers and influence positive opinions about the product.

We can either create a dedicated design together or prepare appropriate prototypes using proven tools. Interface development requires us to pay attention to every detail so that the product is not only functional but also user-friendly.

### 4. Web Application Development
Product testing is also carried out on a regular basis during the development process to catch any errors as soon as possible. After completing the work on the dedicated software, we must comprehensively test the entire product. Testers click on every application element to identify errors.

You have probably already heard of the agile methodology or sprints. As we mentioned earlier, software development is an iterative process that usually takes place in a strictly defined cycle that is divided into smaller stages.

The process is run by a dedicated project manager who ensures smooth cooperation between the development team and the client.

### 5. Launch
You can easily collect the first pieces of feedback from early adopters. Then, we can adjust our work to suit your needs and provide additional support in developing your product.

This is time to launch your product! Product release is a very positive moment, so you can celebrate the end of the time-consuming application development process.

### 6. Maintenance and Further Development
This stage involves collecting information about the product and ideas for improving it in the future. By constantly developing the application, you can boost its attractiveness and reach new users.

We always implement app monitoring tools that enable fast response times in the event of any failure. Monitoring and further web app development are aimed at tracking the way your product works to detect any errors as soon as possible.

## In Conclusion
Many software products those days are created only for browsers. Teams, even those who are experienced in building desktop apps, can meet unexpected challenges when it comes to web-based app creation. In the modern environment, it is important to understand the differences that come with the web application development process flow.

As you know, the web application development process is a comprehensive, well-planned activity that covers the entire product lifecycle. We hope that 6 main steps of web app development process has helped you understand the business value of each stage and learn the most important definitions.
